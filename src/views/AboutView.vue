    <h1>Why I Made This Site</h1>
    <p>
      As a student living at the University View, Rexburg apartment complex, I noticed that the setup UV had for knowing where the shuttles are at what times was incredibly difficult to use. This sparked an idea: a website to easily find specific routes of where the shuttles will be and when. I created a database using Google Firebase's Realtime Database feature to hold all the information from the pamphlet hanging in the UV office, and connected it to a web app made in Vue. I then created components for the specific bus routes (to hold all the information in a readable manner), then added filters to filter down the list into specific routes being shown.

    <h1>What This Site Is For Me</h1>
    <p>
      This project was an excellent challenge for me as a developer because I had never worked with Google Firebase or any kind of web app framework like Vue. Firebase is very easy to use to create a database, and it is quite simple to use in the app once the app and database are properly linked. I found Vue to be challenging but very well documented. I also had a good bit of help from some other developers to learn the system. It was a very good challenge to have to create something from the ground up, and added to my skills as a programmer significantly.
